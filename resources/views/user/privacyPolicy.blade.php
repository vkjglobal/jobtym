                        with our legal obligations to you. The protection of your data is important to us and we have made

                        as we will post any changes here.</p>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies in the relevant countries within our international network. Different
                        countries may adopt slightly different approaches to privacy, so this privacy policy includes
                        country-specific parts. This will allow us to ensure that we comply with all applicable privacy laws
                        regardless of where you are.</p>
                    <h4><strong>1. What information do we collect from Jobseekers on our sites, how do we use them and what
                            should you be aware of?</strong></h4>
                    <h5><strong> 1.1 "paytym.jobs"</strong></h5>

                        data on our website.</p>
                    <p>When you register with "paytym.jobs", we will first save your email address so that we can send you
                        the erp.jobs Services. If you want to register for "paytym.jobs" and at the same time create a CV,
                        then we ask you for further personal datas. The personal datas which we collect for your job
                        application along with your CV includes your email address, name, address, phone number, mobile
                        phone number, photo, gender, citizenship and date of birth ("Personal User Information"). Personal
                        User Information will be kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with potential employers
                        unless you create an active, public CV or give us your express consent. In addition, you have the
                        opportunity to pass on this data â€“ to a potential employer - as far as you expressly authorize it.
                        We already asked for certain datas (email, gender, name, postal code, date of birth) when you sign
                        up in "paytym.jobs". However, you can leave these open (except for the active email address) as long
                        as you do not want to create a CV. When you create a CV, you have to enter different mandatory
                        dates. These can be recognized by the respective asterisk. Incidentally, the storage of personal
                        information is completely optional and voluntary. In particular, we can use the personal data
                        collected in this way to send you offers from potential employers in other ways as well. In order to
                        ensure your proper registration, that is, to prevent unauthorized log-ins on behalf of third
                        parties, we will send you a confirmation email after your registration requesting confirmation of
                        registration.</p>

                        an account will be created when you sign up for the "Job Flyer" service. When you register for the
                        "Job Flyer" you will regularly receive information about job applications that match a previously
                        defined profile from you. In doing so, we not only send you job applications published on erp.jobs,
                        but also other applications from selected partners. erp.jobs can contact you by e-mail or by phone.
